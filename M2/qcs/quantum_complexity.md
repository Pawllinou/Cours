# Quantum Complexity

## Complexity

"This is a quantitative expression of how the algorithmâ€™s time and space requirements grow as the data set or problem size grows."

### Time Complexity Categories

Assume N is the size of the input (the size of a dataset for example)

- Constant time : Doesn't depend on N.
- Polynomial Time : limited by some fixed power of N (N<sup>2</sup> for quadratic, N<sup>3</sup> for cubic, N<sup>5</sup> for quintic, etc.)
- Others including exponential (2<sup>N</sup>) etc.

## Classical vs. Quantum Complexities

### Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
"the quantum algorithm has a better time complexity (linear vs. exponential in
n or logarithmic vs. linear in N) than its classical counterpart. So the speed-up is
real."
with N=2<sup>n</sup>
